An example of a population sampler which simulates the capturing and counting 
of a sample of a poulation to determine the size of the overall population.

Takes Arguments:
  Int Sample Size: The overall size of the population to be sampled
  Int Sample Upper Limit: The maximum subjects in the sample to be captured at a time
  Int Sample Lower Limit: The minimum subjects in the sample to be captured at a time
  Int Amount of Samples: The amount of samples to be taken
  
This program takes in a the above parameters and uses the Mark-Recapture technique to estimate a populations total size. 
The program also demonstrates the use of the Lincoln-Peterson and Schnabel indexes as well.
